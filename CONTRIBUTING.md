# Contributing to Epistola Suite

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Epistola Suite! Epistola Suite is
published by Epistola Nederland B.V. This document provides guidelines and
information for contributors.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

For development setup instructions, see the [README](README.md). In short:

1. Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) version manager
2. Run `./scripts/init.sh` to set up tools
3. Build with `gradle build`
4. Run with `gradle :apps:epistola:bootRun`

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? Please [open an issue](../../issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) with:

- Clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, Java/Node version)

### Suggesting Features

Have an idea? [Open a feature request](../../issues/new?template=feature_request.yml) describing:

- The problem you're trying to solve
- Your proposed solution
- Any alternatives you've considered

### Improving Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome! [Open a documentation issue](../../issues/new?template=documentation.yml) or submit a PR directly.

Everything under `docs/` is indexed in [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) — start there to find
the right page. When you add a page, add it to that index too, and give it a
`> **Status:** …` banner if it describes a design or a point-in-time record rather than
shipped behavior.

### Submitting Code

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (see naming conventions below)
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure tests pass (`gradle test`)
5. Submit a pull request

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with these prefixes:

| Prefix      | Purpose               |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| `feat/`     | New features          |
| `fix/`      | Bug fixes             |
| `docs/`     | Documentation changes |
| `chore/`    | Maintenance tasks     |
| `refactor/` | Code refactoring      |

**Examples:**

- `feat/add-pdf-export`
- `fix/login-redirect-bug`
- `docs/update-api-reference`

### Commit Conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). This enables automatic semantic versioning.

> **Note:** Commit messages are validated by a Git hook (commitlint). If your commit is rejected, check the error message and adjust your commit message format.

> **Note:** A `pre-commit` hook also runs [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) over your staged changes to block accidentally committed secrets (run `mise install` once so the pinned gitleaks is available). Real secrets belong in environment variables / Kubernetes Secrets — see [`docs/encryption.md`](docs/encryption.md).

**Format:** `<type>: <description>`

| Type       | Description                             |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature                             |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                 |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                      |
| `chore`    | Maintenance, dependencies               |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes nor adds |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                |

**Examples:**

```
feat: add PDF export functionality
fix: resolve login redirect loop
docs: update installation instructions
```

**Breaking Changes:**

- Add `!` after type: `feat!: remove deprecated API`
- Or add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit footer

### Commit Signing

Commits should be signed using SSH keys. The `./scripts/init.sh` script configures this automatically.

To verify signing is enabled:

```bash
git config --get commit.gpgsign  # Should return "true"
```

### Changelog Entries

The changelog is read by two audiences: developers in the repo and end users in the product's in-app **Changelog** dialog, which parses and filters entries.

A notable change adds **one file** under `changelog/unreleased/` — never an edit to `CHANGELOG.md`, which holds released history and is assembled at release time. The format lives in [`changelog/README.md`](changelog/README.md):

```markdown
---
type: feat
scopes: [editor]
audience: user
title: List nesting via Tab.
---

You can now author sub-lists without leaving the keyboard.
```

`./gradlew checkChangelogFragments` validates the fragments and requires one for a change to shipped code; label a pull request `no-changelog` when it genuinely needs none. At release, the `release` skill curates the accumulated fragments — merging overlapping entries and cutting implementation detail — and `./gradlew releaseChangelog -PreleaseVersion=X.Y.Z` assembles them into one dated section per release.

Rendered, each entry becomes `- [**[audience]** ]type(scope)[!]: **Title.** …`:

- **`type(scope)` is required.** `type` is a Conventional-Commit type (`feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`) — the same vocabulary as commit messages. `scope` is a required lowercase kebab-case area (e.g. `editor`, `generation`, `cluster`, `locale`, `logs`). A change spanning areas may list comma-separated scopes — `feat(editor,pdf):` — and matches either in the Scope filter.
- **The audience badge is optional and comes first:** `**[user]**` for user-facing changes, `**[dev]**` for developer-internal ones (refactors, test infra, scheduler internals). Omit it for changes relevant to everyone.

The markers are stripped before rendering and surface as chips. The dialog filters by **Audience** (Users / Developers / All — defaults to Users, hiding `**[dev]**`), **Type** (the commit types), and **Scope**, and previews the unreleased fragments at the top as an **Upcoming** entry (excluded from the dashboard's "What's New" badge) — the app reads a rendered file that carries both the released history and those fragments, so the dialog sees one format throughout. Older released sections still use legacy Keep-a-Changelog `### ` headers (grandfathered — type mapped from the section, no scope); don't add `### ` headers to new entries. When a version is cut, the `release` skill adds a short prose **release summary** under the `## [x.y.z]` heading (before the entries), which the dialog shows above that version's entries. These conventions apply only to the root `CHANGELOG.md` — the Helm chart changelog (`charts/epistola/CHANGELOG.md`) is not shown in the UI.

**Important:** Your SSH key must be added to GitHub as a **signing key** (not just authentication):

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys
2. Click "New SSH key"
3. Select **"Signing Key"** as the key type
4. Paste your public key

### Code Style

#### Kotlin (Backend)

- We use [ktlint](https://pinterest.github.io/ktlint/) for code formatting
- Run `gradle ktlintCheck` to check
- Run `gradle ktlintFormat` to auto-fix
- EditorConfig is configured for consistent formatting

#### Thymeleaf + HTMX (Frontend)

- Server-side rendered templates in `apps/epistola/src/main/resources/templates/`
- Use HTMX attributes for dynamic interactions
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

#### TypeScript (Client Components)

- For rich interactive components like the editor in `modules/editor/`
- EditorConfig ensures consistent indentation

### Testing Requirements

- All PRs must pass CI checks
- New features should include tests
- **Backend:** JUnit 5 with Testcontainers (requires Docker)
- **Frontend:** Add tests for new components/utilities

Run tests locally:

```bash
gradle test
```
