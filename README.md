A document suite application built with Spring Boot 4.0.0 and Kotlin, featuring server-side rendered views with Thymeleaf and HTMX.

## Project Structure

```
epistola-suite/
├── apps/
│   └── epistola/          # Main Spring Boot application (Thymeleaf + HTMX)
├── modules/
│   └── editor/            # Rich text editor component (Vite + TypeScript)
├── build.gradle.kts       # Root build configuration
└── settings.gradle.kts    # Module includes
```

## Architecture

The frontend uses a **server-side rendering** approach:

- **Thymeleaf**: Template engine for rendering HTML on the server
- **HTMX**: For dynamic interactions without full page reloads
- **Client components**: Embedded JavaScript modules (like the editor) for features requiring rich client-side interactivity

## Documentation

**Using Epistola?** User documentation — guides and tutorials for authoring
templates and running documents — is published at
**<https://epistola.app/en/learn>**.

**Working on Epistola?** The technical documentation lives in [`docs/`](docs/) and is indexed in
**[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)** — every page grouped by topic, each labelled
with whether it describes shipped behavior, an experimental feature, a design
proposal, or a point-in-time record. It also links the
[architecture decision records](docs/adr/README.md) and the
[catalog wire-format reference](docs/exchange/README.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) version manager

2. Run the init script to set up your development environment:

```bash
./scripts/init.sh
```

This will:

- Configure mise in your shell (bash/zsh) if not already done
- Ensure a UTF-8 locale (see [Platform support](#platform-support) below)
- Install the required tool versions (Java Temurin 25, Node.js 24)
- Install Git hooks (commitlint for conventional commit validation)
- Configure SSH commit signing (if using SSH remote)

### Platform support

Development is actively tested on **macOS** and **Linux**. **Windows is not
tested**; if you're on Windows, develop inside **WSL2** (treated as Linux).

Your shell must use a **UTF-8 locale** (`LANG`/`LC_ALL` ending in `.UTF-8`). The
JVM derives `sun.jnu.encoding` — the charset for file paths — from the OS
locale, and a non-UTF-8 locale (the POSIX `C` locale is the default on many WSL
and minimal Linux images) breaks Kotlin builds when a source name contains a
non-ASCII character:

```
java.nio.file.InvalidPathException: Malformed input or input contains unmappable characters
```

`./scripts/init.sh` configures this automatically. To verify:

```bash
locale charmap                          # -> UTF-8
java -XshowSettings:properties -version 2>&1 | grep sun.jnu.encoding
#                                       # -> sun.jnu.encoding = UTF-8
```

If you change the locale, run `gradle --stop` so the daemon restarts with it.

### Build and Run

Tool versions (Java, Gradle, Node, pnpm and more) come from `.mise.toml`. The frontend builds
first: the editor bundle is a Gradle input, so `gradle build` needs it in place.

```bash
# First time, or after .mise.toml changes
mise install

# Frontend first — also runs the component-registry check
pnpm install
pnpm build

# Build the entire project
gradle build

# Run the application (requires a profile — see Authentication below)
gradle :apps:epistola:bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=local'

# Run it with demo data: a tenant, the demo catalog and a well-known API key
gradle :apps:epistola-demo:bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=demo,local,localauth'
```

Tests: `gradle unitTest` (no Docker), `gradle integrationTest` and `gradle uiTest` (both need
Docker), or `gradle test` for unit plus integration. Style: `gradle ktlintFormat` then
`gradle ktlintCheck`; `pnpm format` covers everything else.

For live frontend work, run the app with the `local` profile in one terminal and
`pnpm --filter @epistola/editor watch` in another — the watch rebuilds `dist/` on change and the
`local` profile serves it from the filesystem.

Software bill of materials:

```bash
gradle :apps:epistola:generateSbom
pnpm --filter @epistola/editor run sbom   # `run` matters: pnpm 11 has its own `sbom` command
```

While generating one, CycloneDX may print `Unknown keyword meta:enum` or `Unknown keyword
deprecated`. Those are upstream SPDX schema-vocabulary notices from networknt, not Gradle
deprecations — leave the generated SBOM validation enabled.

### Authentication

A Spring profile **must** be set to configure authentication. Without one, the app will fail to start.

| Setup             | Auth Method                                  | Use Case                   |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `local`           | Form login (in-memory users)                 | Local development          |
| `local,keycloak`  | Form login + OAuth2/OIDC with local Keycloak | Testing both login methods |
| `localauth`       | Form login with env-var credentials          | Staging/test fallback      |
| `prod` + OIDC env | OAuth2/OIDC with any compliant provider      | Production                 |

**Local development** — uses in-memory users, no external dependencies:

```bash
gradle :apps:epistola:bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=local'
# Login: admin@local / admin  or  user@local / user
```

**With local services** — start PostgreSQL and Keycloak via the unified Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL + Keycloak (admin console at http://localhost:4002, admin/admin)
docker compose -f apps/epistola/docker/docker-compose.yaml up -d

# Or start only PostgreSQL (sufficient for local profile)
docker compose -f apps/epistola/docker/docker-compose.yaml up -d postgres

# Run with form login and OAuth2
gradle :apps:epistola:bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=local,keycloak'
```

**Production** — configure OIDC via environment variables or the Helm chart's `oidc.*` values. Do not use the `keycloak` profile outside local development.

```bash
export SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_KEYCLOAK_CLIENTID=epistola-suite
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_KEYCLOAK_CLIENTSECRET=<your-secret>
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_KEYCLOAK_SCOPE=openid,profile,email
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_KEYCLOAK_ISSUERURI=https://sso.example.com/realms/epistola
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCESERVER_JWT_ISSUERURI=https://sso.example.com/realms/epistola
```

See [docs/auth.md](docs/auth.md) for full details on OIDC setup, auto-provisioning, and safety guards.

### Docker

Build a Docker image:

```bash
gradle :apps:epistola:bootBuildImage
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 epistola:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

### Helm Chart

The application can be deployed to Kubernetes using the Helm chart published to the OCI registry.

Install from the OCI registry:

```bash
helm install epistola oci://ghcr.io/epistola-app/charts/epistola --version <version>
```

Upgrade an existing release:

```bash
helm upgrade epistola oci://ghcr.io/epistola-app/charts/epistola --version <version>
```

Customize the deployment with values:

```bash
helm install epistola oci://ghcr.io/epistola-app/charts/epistola \
  --version <version> \
  --set image.tag=1.0.0 \
  --set ingress.enabled=true \
  --set ingress.hosts[0].host=epistola.example.com
```

See `charts/epistola/values.yaml` for all available configuration options.

## Modules

### apps/epistola

The main Spring Boot application that serves the document suite. Uses Thymeleaf for server-side HTML rendering and HTMX for dynamic interactions.

### modules/editor

A Vite-based TypeScript editor component that builds as a library and is embedded in the main application for rich text editing functionality. The built assets are served from `/editor/`.

To develop the editor standalone:

```bash
cd modules/editor
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Development

### Code Style

This project uses [ktlint](https://pinterest.github.io/ktlint/) for Kotlin code style. Run the linter:

```bash
# Check code style
gradle ktlintCheck

# Auto-format code
gradle ktlintFormat
```

### Testing

```bash
gradle test
```

Tests use [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.org/) which requires Docker to be running.

### GitHub MCP (AI-Assisted Development)

This project includes a GitHub MCP server for AI-assisted issue and project management. It enables AI assistants (like Claude Code) to interact with GitHub Issues and Projects.

**Setup:**

```bash
pnpm run setup:github-mcp
```

This will:

1. Open GitHub to create a fine-grained Personal Access Token with minimal permissions
2. Validate the token
3. Store it securely in your OS credential manager (macOS Keychain or Windows Credential Vault)

**Features:**

- Create and manage GitHub Issues
- Work with Pull Requests
- Track backlog in GitHub Projects

The configuration is in `.mcp.json` (safe to commit - no secrets stored).

## CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD:

- **Build and test** runs on all PRs and main branch pushes
- **Docker images** are published to ghcr.io:
  - On main: tagged with semantic version (based on conventional commits), SHA, and `latest`
  - On PRs with `publish` label: tagged with `{version}-pr-{number}-{run}`
- **Helm charts** are published to ghcr.io OCI registry:
  - Triggered when changes are detected in the `charts/` directory
  - Tagged with `chart-X.Y.Z` (separate versioning from the app)
  - Published to `oci://ghcr.io/epistola-app/charts`

### Conventional Commits

Version bumps are determined automatically from commit messages:

- `feat:` - minor version bump
- `fix:` - patch version bump
- `feat!:` or `fix!:` with `BREAKING CHANGE` - major version bump

Both the app and Helm chart follow this convention. The Helm chart version is only bumped when changes are made to the `charts/` directory.

## Support and upgrades

Epistola Nederland B.V. publishes releases when ready and expects installations
to stay on a **supported** version. Upgrades are designed to be direct (no
intermediate releases required), with automated migrations and documented
manual steps when needed. Downgrades after a successful upgrade are not
supported; rollback of a **failed** upgrade is supported via backup restore.

Full details: [SUPPORT_POLICY.md](SUPPORT_POLICY.md). Currently supported
versions are published separately (website / release metadata), not hardcoded
in the policy. See also [docs/version-check.md](docs/version-check.md) and
[docs/migrations.md](docs/migrations.md).

The installation-wide version check is enabled by default. Once per day, one
node retrieves the public release metadata and sends the running suite version
plus the stable installation id; Epistola Nederland B.V. uses that request to
understand how many active installations run each version. Disable it with
`epistola.version-check.enabled=false`.
