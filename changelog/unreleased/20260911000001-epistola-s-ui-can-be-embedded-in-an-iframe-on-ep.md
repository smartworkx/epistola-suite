title: Epistola's UI can be embedded in an iframe on epistola.app, demo-mode only.
---

Adds a `postMessage` bridge (`epistola.embedding.*` config, gated CSP `frame-ancestors`) so a host page can request typed-identity navigation and receive navigation/resource-changed notifications; epistola-suite ships no training content itself. The standalone editor page (`templates/editor`) carries the same config island as the shell, so `navigated` fires for `/variants/…/editor` paths too. Successful `GET` requests are reported as well — the request path and the parameter _names_ only, never parameter values, request bodies or non-GET traffic — so a host can distinguish search, filter, sort and pagination without receiving what the user typed.
