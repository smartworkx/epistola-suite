# Epistola Suite documentation

This is the **technical** documentation — how the suite is built, deployed and
extended. Everything under `docs/` is indexed here in one place; start with
[Project overview](epistola.md) if you are new, otherwise jump to the topic you
need below.

Looking for **user** documentation — guides and tutorials for authoring
templates and running documents? That is published at
<https://epistola.app/en/learn>.

Repository-level documents live at the root: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md),
[`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md), [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md),
[`SUPPORT_POLICY.md`](../SUPPORT_POLICY.md), [`VULNERABILITIES.md`](../VULNERABILITIES.md),
[`DISCLAIMER.md`](../DISCLAIMER.md), [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) (conventions for AI-assisted contributions; `CLAUDE.md` imports it).

## How to read the Status column

Not every page describes shipped behavior. Each entry is labelled:

| Label                | Meaning                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Current**          | Describes behavior as it ships today. Safe to rely on.                                                                      |
| **Alpha** / **Beta** | Ships, but experimental. Breaking changes may land in a MINOR release (see [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#stability-contract)). |
| **Proposed**         | A design or plan. Some of it may be built; file paths in it are proposals, not a map of the code.                           |
| **Record**           | A point-in-time artefact — a review, a measurement, sample output. True when written, not maintained.                       |

A page that is not **Current** says so in a `> **Status:** …` blockquote directly
under its title. That banner, not this table, is authoritative.

## Decision records

Architecture Decision Records live in [`adr/`](adr/README.md) — that index lists
every record with its status.

## Historical plans

Implementation plans that have been carried out (or abandoned) are kept in
[`plans/`](plans/README.md) for the reasoning they contain. They are **not**
current documentation.

## Conventions for new docs

- **One `# H1`** per file, matching the file's subject.
- **kebab-case filenames**: `resource-reference-graph.md`, not `resource_reference_graph.md`.
- **Status banner.** If the page is not current shipped behavior, put a
  `> **Status:** …` blockquote immediately under the H1 saying what it is —
  design, alpha/beta, or a dated record.
- **Add it here.** A doc that is not in this index is a doc nobody finds.
- **Link with relative paths** so links resolve on GitHub and in an editor.
- Run `pnpm format` before committing; Markdown is formatted too.
