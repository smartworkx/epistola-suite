# Catalog Versioning & Upgrading

How catalogs declare a version, how "is this a new version?" is decided, and
how that flows across the web UI, REST, MCP, catalog exchange and the bundled
catalogs. Companion to [`docs/exchange/README.md`](exchange/README.md).

> This covers the **release version + content fingerprint** axis. For how it
> relates to the other version concepts (template/contract/stencil publish, and
> the wire-format `schemaVersion`), see [version-axes.md](version-axes.md).

## Why

Authored catalogs had no real version: the ZIP export stamped
`LocalDate.now()`, and every "changed?" decision (`DemoLoader`,
`SystemCatalogBootstrap`, `UpgradeCatalog`) was an exact **string equality** on
`installed_release_version` (a SUBSCRIBED-only column). An author could not say
"this is now a new version" with any meaning, and re-export produced a
different "version" even when nothing changed (or the same one when it did).

## Model

A catalog is **one row per `(tenant_key, slug)` with one live resource set** —
there is never a parallel install of two versions.

- **AUTHORED (publisher side)** — one live, editable working copy. Cutting a
  release records an **immutable boundary** in `catalog_releases`
  (author-set SemVer + content fingerprint + notes + a manifest snapshot) and
  advances the `catalogs.released_version` / `released_fingerprint` /
  `released_at` pointer. `catalog_releases` is AUTHORED release **history**
  (changelog), not parallel installs and **not** the consumer upgrade-diff
  baseline (a SUBSCRIBED consumer's DB has no `catalog_releases` rows).
- **SUBSCRIBED (consumer side)** — exactly one installed state.
  `installed_release_version` + `installed_fingerprint` record which release is
  installed; `installed_resource_fingerprints` (JSONB) records the per-resource
  source-side digests of that release — the Phase 2 upgrade-diff baseline.
  `UpgradeCatalog` replaces resources **in place**.

`installed_*` (SUBSCRIBED) and `released_*` / `catalog_releases` (AUTHORED) are
orthogonal — `CatalogType` is exclusive, so only one applies to a given
catalog. An authored `1.4.0` exported and subscribed elsewhere flows its
version + fingerprint through the manifest into the subscriber's
`installed_release_version` / `installed_fingerprint`, so values stay coherent
end to end.

## Versioning scheme: SemVer + content fingerprint

- **SemVer** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) is author-controlled, recorded per release.
  Implemented by the dependency-free
  [`SemVer`](../modules/epistola-core/src/main/kotlin/app/epistola/suite/catalog/SemVer.kt)
  value type (parse / compare / bump). Releases must strictly increase.
- **Content fingerprint** is a deterministic lowercase-hex SHA-256 of the
  catalog's canonical content, computed by
  [`CatalogCanonicalizer`](../modules/epistola-core/src/main/kotlin/app/epistola/suite/catalog/CatalogCanonicalizer.kt)
  (wired by `CatalogFingerprintService`). It identifies _content_ independently
  of the version label — "is this actually new?" is a fingerprint comparison,
  not a string compare.

### Fingerprint algorithm

Hashes, in order: the complete portable catalog identity and discovery metadata
(`slug`, name, description, qualified attributes, case-preserving keywords,
ordered presentation assets, and license); each resource
sorted by `"$type/$slug"`, rendered as `key  <canonical resource JSON>  <asset
bytes SHA-256 | "" | "MISSING">`; then a sorted, `;`-joined dependencies line.
Resource JSON is canonical: the serialized `ResourceDetail` is parsed (floats
as `BigDecimal`), the `resource` subtree taken, every object's keys recursively
sorted (array order preserved — arrays are ordered content), then compact-written.
Excluded by construction: `release.*`, `schemaVersion`, every `updatedAt`,
`detailUrl`. Asset _binary bytes_ are folded in via their own SHA-256 (mirrors
the font-family fingerprint), so swapping an image flips the fingerprint even
though the `AssetResource` JSON is unchanged.

**Wire-format migration is fingerprint-transparent.** Because `schemaVersion` is
excluded, the whole-catalog import migration ([ADR 0007](adr/0007-catalog-wire-format-migrations.md),
[`docs/exchange/`](exchange/README.md#wire-format-version-gate)) — which upgrades
an older payload's shape and re-stamps `schemaVersion` to the current catalog
version — is **preserved verbatim**: `release.fingerprint` / `release.version` are never
touched or recomputed during migration, so a migrated import compares as the same
source release and the idempotent-re-import SKIP still holds.

**One definition (invariant).** There is a single canonicalization, run over
the **serialized resource-detail JSON** (the exact wire form). The value
stamped into an exported manifest / stored on release and the value any
consumer recomputes from those detail bytes via
[`fingerprintFromSource`](../modules/epistola-core/src/main/kotlin/app/epistola/suite/catalog/CatalogCanonicalizer.kt)
**agree by construction** — there is no separate "typed object" path that could
diverge for `Float`/`Double` fields (numbers never round-trip through
`Double`/`Float.toString`, whose algorithm changed across JDKs — JDK-4511638).
Guarded by `CatalogFingerprintEquivalenceTest`. The export ZIP and the
fingerprint are built from the **same**
[`CatalogContentBuilder`](../modules/epistola-core/src/main/kotlin/app/epistola/suite/catalog/CatalogContentBuilder.kt),
so "the bytes you export" ≡ "the bytes you fingerprint".

### Portable discovery metadata

Catalog wire v6 stores discovery metadata alongside catalog identity:

- qualified attribute assignments (`catalog`, `key`, `value`);
- exact-case keywords;
- an icon and ordered image gallery referencing assets in the same catalog;
- license name, optional SPDX expression, absolute HTTP(S) URL, and copyright.

AUTHORED catalogs edit these fields from the catalog browse page. SUBSCRIBED
catalogs show source metadata read-only. URL registration, URL upgrade, ZIP
import, export, release snapshots, and tenant snapshots preserve the same typed
value. A metadata-only publisher edit appears in the upgrade preview and can be
applied without fabricating a resource change.

Presentation media is deliberately **installed-only**. Epistola never proxies
or auto-downloads an uninstalled source asset just to render catalog chrome.
The browse page shows an unavailable placeholder; local exports and snapshots
omit missing icon references and filter missing gallery entries while preserving
the order of installed entries. The full source metadata remains stored so the
presentation appears as assets are installed later.

## Size a catalog to be adopted whole

A consumer installs a catalog whole and upgrades it whole; there is no way to take a subset
(see [the installation guide](catalog-exchange-installation.md#why-a-catalog-is-one-unit)). So the
catalog boundary is the adoption boundary, and drawing it is an authoring decision, not something to
leave to each consumer.

Keep a catalog focused on resources that belong together and are adopted together. When two groups
of resources have independent audiences or release rhythms — a house style versus a set of letters,
say — publish them as two catalogs and declare the dependency between them. That is cheaper for
everyone than one large catalog nobody wants all of.

## Cutting a release (AUTHORED)

The web UI catalog list shows a **Release new version** action (AUTHORED only)
opening a dialog: Patch / Minor / Major quick-picks, an editable SemVer field,
release notes, and a drift line ("This working copy has unreleased changes" vs
"No changes since the last release"). It dispatches
[`ReleaseCatalogVersion`](../modules/epistola-core/src/main/kotlin/app/epistola/suite/catalog/commands/ReleaseCatalogVersion.kt):
AUTHORED-only, parses + monotonic-checks the SemVer, computes the fingerprint,
inserts the `catalog_releases` row (with the manifest snapshot) and advances
the catalog pointer — one transaction. Releasing content byte-identical to a
prior release is allowed (notes-only re-release) but logged.

[`GetCatalogReleaseStatus`](../modules/epistola-core/src/main/kotlin/app/epistola/suite/catalog/queries/GetCatalogReleaseStatus.kt)
is the shared primitive (latest version/fingerprint, working fingerprint,
`hasUnreleasedChanges`, suggested next bumps, history).

## Export drift policy

`ExportCatalogZip` always emits a fingerprint describing the **actual exported
bytes**. The version label encodes release state and export is never blocked:

- never released → `0.0.0-dev` (logged WARN)
- working copy differs from the latest release → `<version>-dev` (logged WARN)
- working copy matches the latest release → the clean released version

`-dev` makes drift unmistakable in the filename and manifest. (Serving an
immutable release snapshot so subscribers never see in-progress edits is a
Phase 2 hardening.)

### Drift hint in the catalog list

So the `-dev` outcome isn't only discovered at download time, the catalog
list shows `v0.1.0 · pending changes` for an AUTHORED, released catalog whose
working copy drifted. This is a **cheap heuristic, not the fingerprint** (the
export `-dev`/fingerprint stays authoritative): the catalog-management list
query `ListCatalogsForManagement` returns each catalog as a `CatalogListRow`
(the shared `Catalog` plus a list-only `pendingChanges` flag), the flag
computed in one `LEFT JOIN` comparing `MAX(updated_at | published_at |
created_at)` across the catalog's resource/version tables to the baseline
`GREATEST(released_at, imported_at)`. The flag is **not** on `Catalog` itself
(browse/REST/MCP read that shared model and don't show drift); it is purely a
list-page concern, so the list-page query owns it and the template reads
`row.pendingChanges` — no parallel id set, no template-side cross-reference.

All three timestamps share the **database** clock: resource `updated_at` and
`catalogs.imported_at` are Postgres `NOW()`, and `ReleaseCatalogVersion`
stamps `released_at` via `SELECT NOW()` (not JVM time) precisely so this
comparison is exact and not skewed by JVM↔DB clock drift.

`catalogs.imported_at` is set at the **end** of `ImportCatalogZip` (after the
resource upserts, so ≥ their `updated_at`). It exists specifically so a no-op
ZIP **re-import** — which bumps every resource's `updated_at` — advances the
baseline in lockstep and is **not** mistaken for an edit. Column choice
mirrors what the fingerprint sees: `updated_at` for live rows, `published_at`
for `*_versions` (a draft-only edit doesn't change the published export, so it
correctly stays clean), `created_at` for `assets`.

Conservative by construction: it can **over-warn** (edit-then-revert to
byte-identical, a re-publish of unchanged content) and the only **under-warn**
is a deletion-only change (no surviving row's timestamp moves) — in every case
the export's `-dev` label/fingerprint is the authoritative backstop.

## Publishing a release to Epistola Exchange

An AUTHORED catalog release can also create a durable Exchange publication
outbox entry in the same database transaction. The outbox retains the exact ZIP
for that immutable release; Exchange availability never determines whether the
local release succeeds. Imported releases suppress publication, and an existing
unchanged current release can be queued explicitly. Setting precedence,
namespace binding, status transitions, and retries are specified in
[`catalog-exchange-publication.md`](catalog-exchange-publication.md).

## Importing a ZIP

A ZIP import always targets a catalog **type**. A slug that already exists with
a _different_ type is rejected (it would flip ownership semantics). What the
import then means depends entirely on that type:

### AUTHORED — content transport into your editable copy

A release is an **authorship act**, so a ZIP import only adopts a release in
the one case where there is no authorship to protect:

- **Import that _creates_ the catalog** → no release history yet, so the
  manifest's version becomes the **initial release**, provided it is a clean
  SemVer (not a `-dev`/legacy label), a `release.fingerprint` is present, and
  every resource imported. The ZIP round-trip fingerprint is deterministic, so
  the recorded release row is real and consistent — not fabricated. Result: the
  catalog shows the published version, not "unreleased".
- **Import into an _existing_ AUTHORED catalog** → an _edit_ to a catalog you
  already version. Release state is **never** fabricated or changed; the
  working copy shows as drift ("unreleased changes") and the owner releases
  deliberately. The import dialog's **"If this catalog already exists"** choice
  (`ImportCatalogZip.authoredMode`) decides what happens to resources you have
  locally that the ZIP doesn't:
  - **`MERGE`** (default) — upsert the ZIP's resources, **keep** local-only
    resources (overlay);
  - **`REPLACE`** — make the catalog _exactly_ the ZIP: also **delete**
    local-only resources. Conflict-checked **before mutating** — a pruned
    resource still referenced from another catalog blocks the whole import
    (`CatalogUpgradeConflictException`), the same shared
    `CatalogUpgradeAnalyzer` the SUBSCRIBED path uses. A failed install skips
    the prune (no half-replace). Release state is _still_ untouched.

  (Either way, resources present in the ZIP overwrite the local copy — that is
  inherent to importing them; the choice is only about local-_only_ resources.)

  The REST `importCatalog` operation exposes the same choice as an optional
  `authoredMode` form field (`MERGE` default, `REPLACE`), and its
  `ImportCatalogResponse.aborted` boolean reports whether a SUBSCRIBED-ZIP
  upgrade aborted on a failed install (catalog left on its previous release —
  a retry-safe outcome the `installed`/`updated`/`failed`/`total` counts alone
  cannot express). There is no MCP import tool yet, so import is not an MCP
  surface.

- **`-dev`/never-released manifest** → nothing real to adopt; stays unreleased.

### SUBSCRIBED — the ZIP _is_ the upgrade

A SUBSCRIBED catalog is a managed mirror. With no source URL to poll, importing
a newer ZIP **is** its upgrade — and it runs the **full `UpgradeCatalog`
contract**, the ZIP merely being the transport instead of an HTTP source:

- **conflict-checked before any mutation** — a stale resource still referenced
  from another catalog blocks the whole import (`CatalogUpgradeConflictException`);
- resources are installed/replaced, then **stale resources are pruned**
  (shared `CatalogUpgradeAnalyzer.removeStale` — one definition with the URL
  path);
- **abort-on-failed-install** — if any resource fails, stale is _not_ pruned
  and `installed_*` is _not_ advanced, so the catalog stays on its previous
  release and a re-import retries (never a silent half-upgrade);
- on success `installed_release_version` / `installed_fingerprint` /
  `installed_resource_fingerprints` are advanced from the manifest, computed
  with the **exact same** canonicalization as a URL source — so drift
  detection and the upgrade preview are consistent regardless of transport.

So SUBSCRIBED upgrade has two equivalent transports — re-fetch a source URL
(`UpgradeCatalog`) or re-import a ZIP — with identical semantics.

## Bundled catalogs

`demo` and `system` ship a real SemVer and a committed `release.fingerprint` in
their `catalog.json`.
[`BundledCatalogFingerprintTest`](../modules/epistola-core/src/test/kotlin/app/epistola/suite/catalog/BundledCatalogFingerprintTest.kt)
recomputes the fingerprint from classpath content and asserts it equals the
committed value — the drift gate (analogous to the `pg_dump --schema-only`
migration check). Editing a bundled resource without regenerating the committed
fingerprint fails the build. `DemoLoader` and `InstallSystemCatalog` decide
install/upgrade/no-op by **fingerprint** (`manifest.release.fingerprint` vs
`catalogs.installed_fingerprint`), logging the SemVer transition for humans.

To regenerate after an intentional change: run the test, paste the reported
"actual" fingerprint into the catalog's `catalog.json`, and bump
`release.version`.

## Surfaces

| Surface  | Exposure                                                                     |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Web UI   | Version column (`v<version>` / `unreleased`); Release dialog (AUTHORED)      |
| REST     | `CatalogDto.releasedVersion` + `fingerprint` (read-only)                     |
| MCP      | Release fields plus discovery metadata and metadata upgrade diff (read-only) |
| Exchange | `ReleaseInfo.fingerprint` in the manifest; `schemaVersion` 4                 |

The release **action** is intentionally UI-only in Phase 1 (deliberate, human;
read-state parity is delivered everywhere). A REST/MCP release endpoint can be
added later if automation demand appears.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 2 — upgrade diff/preview.** _Backend landed._ A SUBSCRIBED consumer
  has **no `catalog_releases` snapshot** (that table is AUTHORED/publisher
  state), so the diff is **source-vs-source**, not snapshot-vs-installed: the
  per-resource source-side digests are captured into
  `catalogs.installed_resource_fingerprints` (JSONB) at `RegisterCatalog` /
  `UpgradeCatalog`, exactly alongside `installed_fingerprint` and with the same
  provenance (computed from the source manifest, never publisher-authored).
  `PreviewCatalogUpgrade` re-fetches the manifest, recomputes the same
  per-resource digests, and classifies every `(type, slug)` as
  ADDED / REMOVED / CHANGED / UNCHANGED — so a CHANGED verdict means the
  _publisher_ changed that resource, never install round-trip noise. The
  per-resource digest reuses the **exact** whole-catalog fingerprint pipeline
  (`CatalogCanonicalizer.perResourceFingerprints*`); cross-catalog conflicts on
  the removal set are computed by the shared `CatalogUpgradeAnalyzer` that
  `UpgradeCatalog` also throws on, so a blocking conflict surfaces in the
  preview before Apply. **UI:** an **explicit, user-driven** check — a refresh
  **icon** in the row's actions cell (never auto-polls) renders the result in
  the **Version column**: green `vX` (up to date), greyed `vX` + clickable
  `→ vY` (update available — the new version named; opens the Review dialog),
  `vX · ZIP` (ZIP-managed mirror — no source URL, upgrade by re-importing),
  or `vX · check failed` (source unreachable). The "Review catalog upgrade"
  dialog shows the version delta, change buckets, conflicts with a
  server-rendered disabled Apply, and the resources new in this release listed
  for information — an upgrade reconciles the whole manifest, so they arrive
  with it rather than being opted into. **Read parity:** REST
  `GET /tenants/{tenantId}/catalogs/{catalogId}/upgrade-preview`
  (`CatalogUpgradeDiff`) and MCP `preview_catalog_upgrade`; the upgrade
  _action_ stays UI-only. Still open: ZIP-import dry-run.
- **Phase 3 — dependency SemVer ranges.** Implement the reserved
  `DependencyRef.versionRange` (catalog-level, e.g. `system >=1.2.0 <2.0.0`),
  validated against the dependency catalog's installed/released version at
  import/upgrade; surfaced in the Phase 2 preview. The snapshot JSON already
  round-trips an unknown `versionRange` and `SemVer` is the comparison
  primitive — no Phase 1 rework.
