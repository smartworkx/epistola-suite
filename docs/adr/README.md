# Architecture Decision Records

Each ADR records one decision: the context that forced it, the options weighed,
what was chosen, and what that costs. They are **append-only history** — an ADR
is never rewritten to match a later change of mind. A decision that is revisited
gets a new ADR that supersedes the old one, or an explicit addendum inside it.

## Adding an ADR

1. Take the next free number; filename `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`.
2. Open with the standard metadata block, then `## Context`,
   `## Considered options`, `## Decision`, `## Consequences`, `## References`:

   ```markdown
   # ADR 0016: Title

   - **Status:** Proposed
   - **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
   - **Deciders:** Epistola team
   - **Tags:** comma, separated, topics
   ```

3. Move **Status** to `Accepted` (or `Rejected`/`Superseded by ADR NNNN`) when the
   decision is taken, and append `— implemented` once it ships. Keep the row in
   the table above in step with the file.
4. Add the row here **and** link the ADR from the feature doc it governs.
