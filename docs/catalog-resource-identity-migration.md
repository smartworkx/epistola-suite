# Catalog resource identity migration

> **Status:** Proposed. A plan, largely carried out by the relocation work — file paths in it are
> the proposal's, not a map of the code.

Plan for making every catalog resource relocatable by separating **identity** from **location** and
**address**. Implements the target model in
[ADR 0014](adr/0014-safe-catalog-resource-relocation.md).

## Why

A resource's address — `(tenant_key, catalog_key, slug)` — is currently also its primary key. That
one decision is the source of every difficulty in moving a resource between catalogs: references
name an address, so changing location changes identity, so every reference has to be rewritten,
aliased, or blocked.

Exchange between installations genuinely must be address-based, because tenant-local UUIDs are not
portable. That is a requirement on the **wire**. It was applied to **storage**, where it was never
needed.

The end state is that a move is one statement:

```sql
UPDATE stencils SET catalog_key = ? WHERE tenant_key = ? AND resource_id = ?
```

…plus a slug-collision check. Nothing to rewrite, because nothing internal stored an address.

## Target model

Every resource belongs to exactly one tenant, permanently — cross-tenant transfer is out of scope
(ADR 0014). Within that tenant it has one immutable identity and two mutable attributes. Its
address is what those two attributes compose to, not a third thing stored anywhere.

| Concept                | Representation                          | Changed by    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Tenant**             | `tenant_key`, the isolation boundary    | nothing, ever |
| **Identity**           | `resource_id UUID`, never exported      | nothing       |
| **Catalog membership** | `catalog_key` column, not part of a key | a move        |
| **Slug**               | its name within that catalog            | a rename      |

The **address** is `catalog_key` + `slug`, derived at the boundaries that need it. This is what
makes each operation a single-attribute change: a move sets catalog membership, a rename sets the
slug, and neither disturbs identity or anything referring to it. Today both attributes are welded
into the primary key, which is why changing either one breaks every reference.

`tenant_key` leads every key and every foreign key even though `resource_id` is a UUID and unique on
its own. That is deliberate: it makes tenant isolation a property of the schema rather than of each
query remembering a predicate, and it keeps a tenant's rows contiguous in every index. A join that
drops `tenant_key` still returns correct rows but stops using the index — a regression this branch
already hit once, in three `stencil_versions` joins.

Rules:

1. `(tenant_key, resource_id)` is the primary key of every resource table.
2. `UNIQUE (tenant_key, catalog_key, slug)` keeps addresses unambiguous.
3. Child and version tables key on the parent's `resource_id` and **never** denormalise the
   parent's catalog or slug.
4. Internal references target identity: relational ones are `resource_id` foreign keys; in-content
   ones carry `{ target, catalogKey, key }`, where `target` resolves and the address records
   authored intent and remains the fallback for a reference whose target does not exist.
5. Address is computed at the boundary — export, URLs, REST, MCP — and mapped back on import.
6. Aliases become an external-redirect layer for bookmarked URLs and external callers. Expirable,
   and never consulted by internal resolution.
7. The address lives on the resource's own row; `catalog_resources` keeps a copy, maintained by
   `sync_catalog_resource_identity`, so polymorphic lookup does not need a seven-way `UNION`. That
   duplication is deliberate and was re-examined before merge — see
   [ADR 0020](adr/0020-where-a-catalog-resource-address-lives.md) for why the registry is not the
   sole holder.
8. In Kotlin an identity is a `ResourceIdentity`, never a bare `UUID` — one more `UUID` in a
   signature full of them is exactly how a document id ends up where a template's identity belongs.
   Deliberately not called `ResourceId`: in `common.ids` a `…Id` (`TemplateId`, `CatalogId`) is an
   address chain, which is the one thing an identity is defined not to be. It binds through
   `UuidIdArgumentFactory` and reads back through `UuidIdColumnMapper`; `mapTo(ResourceIdentity)`
   does **not** work, because JDBI's Kotlin plugin claims the class for constructor binding first
   (pinned by `JdbiUuidIdMapperIT`).

## Invariants during the migration

- **Forward-only, non-destructive.** Every step is add → backfill → verify → swap → drop, each as
  its own timestamped migration. See [`migrations.md`](migrations.md).
- **No step leaves the app unable to boot on the previous schema version** until its swap migration
  has run. Deploys are not atomic with migrations.
- **Old and new constraints coexist** through the swap step, so a failure rolls back to a schema
  that still enforces integrity.
- Backfills are verified by a row-count equality assertion in the same migration, not by inspection.
- `DataPreservationMigrationIT` must stay green at every step — it is the guard that RC1-era data
  survives.

## Sequence

Two independent axes determine the work for a type, and they rank differently:

- **Who points at me** — the references that must be re-targeted at identity, split between content
  (`ResourceReferenceSites` kinds) and relational foreign keys.
- **What I own** — child and version tables that must be re-keyed onto the parent's `resource_id`
  and stripped of denormalised address columns.

| Type                            | Who points at me                               | What I own                         |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `variant_attribute_definitions` | variant attributes JSONB map — **done**        | — **done**                         |
| `code_lists`                    | 1 relational FK — **re-keyed**                 | `code_list_entries` — **re-keyed** |
| `assets`                        | content `IMAGE_ASSET`, `font_variants`         | —                                  |
| `fonts`                         | content `FONT_FAMILY`, theme fingerprints      | `font_variants`                    |
| `themes`                        | content `THEME_OVERRIDE`, 2 FKs — **re-keyed** | —                                  |
| `stencils`                      | content `STENCIL_INSERTION` — **re-keyed**     | `stencil_versions` — **re-keyed**  |
| `document_templates`            | **nothing**                                    | 7 FKs, 3 modules — **re-keyed**    |

Templates invert: nothing references a template as a dependency, so their reference work is nil and
all their difficulty is in what they own.

Recommended order — `variant_attribute_definitions`, `code_lists`, `assets`, `fonts`, `themes`,
`stencils`, `document_templates` — takes the cheapest on both axes first and leaves templates last.
A type becomes movable once its own two axes are done; it does not wait for the others.

## Phases

1. **Re-key `variant_attribute_definitions`** using the recipe below. No dependants, no owned
   children — it proves the whole recipe in one small change.
2. **Generalise the move command.** It hardcodes `UPDATE stencils` today; with identity separated it
   needs only a per-type table map, not the rewrite-strategy SPI Option E would have required.
   Doing it here rather than last means step 1 ships a movable type, validating re-key → move →
   verify end to end on the simplest subject.
3. **Re-key the remaining types** in the order above, one per change. Each becomes movable on
   landing.
4. **Carry `target` in content references** — independent of steps 1 and 3, runnable in parallel.
   Only the four content-referenced types need it.
5. **Templates**, applying the pin/follow decisions recorded below.
6. **Delete the interim machinery**: plan/preview/fingerprint, rewrite strategies, the move-time
   pin of relative references, address reservation and its release command, and write-time
   qualification. Keep a preview for policy checks only — permissions, released
   catalogs, slug collisions.

> **All seven are re-keyed.** `variant_attribute_definitions` went first — its references are keys
> in `template_variants.attributes`, live mutable configuration, so the move rewrites every one and
> none survives on an alias, and it has no owned children. That made it the right subject for
> proving the recipe, which the other six then followed:
> `V20260905090100` re-keys attributes, code lists, fonts, assets, themes and stencils;
> `V20260905090200` re-keys templates, with the quality and load-test modules rebuilding their own
> foreign keys immediately after.

## The per-table recipe

For resource table `R` with dependants `D₁…Dₙ`:

1. **Add** — `R.resource_id` already exists for all seven types (`V20260905090000`). Add
   `Dᵢ.<r>_resource_id UUID` nullable.
2. **Backfill** — populate each `Dᵢ` from `R` by the current composite address; assert every row
   was matched.
3. **Constrain** — `SET NOT NULL`, add the `resource_id` foreign key **alongside** the existing
   composite one. Both now enforce the same relationship.
4. **Cut over reads/writes** — queries and commands move to `resource_id`. The composite columns are
   still written and still constrained, so this step is reversible.
5. **Swap the key** — make `(tenant_key, resource_id)` the primary key of `R`; replace the address
   uniqueness with `UNIQUE (tenant_key, catalog_key, slug)`.
6. **Drop** — remove the composite foreign keys and the denormalised address columns from `Dᵢ`.

Step 6 is what actually unlocks relocation for that type: once no dependant stores the parent's
catalog, moving the parent is a single column update.

Step 6 is done everywhere. No dependant of any type stores its parent's address, and no foreign
key anywhere is `ON UPDATE CASCADE` — the interim shape that carried the address along is gone,
which is what makes ADR 0014's rule ("no foreign key is weakened or dropped to make a move
succeed") true rather than aspirational.

## Templates: the case that needs a decision, not just a migration

`document_templates` is referenced by seven foreign keys across **three modules**:

- core: `template_variants`, `contract_versions`, `documents`, `document_requests`
- `epistola-quality`: two, from the findings ledger
- `epistola-load-test`: one

`documents` and `document_requests` are **`PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at)`** and carry a
three-level composite chain — `document_templates` → `template_variants` → `template_versions` —
every level of which includes `catalog_key`.

This forces a product decision:

> When a template moves catalogs, do historical generation records follow it, or pin to where it
> lived at generation time?

**Recommendation: pin.** A generation record states what happened — this document was produced from
this template, in this catalog, at this time. Rewriting its `catalog_key` on a later move edits
history, and doing it via `ON UPDATE CASCADE` rewrites an unbounded number of partitioned rows
inside the move's transaction, which is operationally unacceptable for what should be a
single-row update.

So generation history takes a different shape from the recipe above:

- add `template_resource_id` for identity, backfilled and constrained;
- **keep** `catalog_key` / `template_key` / `variant_key` / `version_key` as recorded historical
  facts, no longer foreign keys;
- drop the composite foreign keys, which is what currently makes the template immovable.

The quality findings ledger asks the same question and gets the **opposite** answer. A finding is
live state about a current subject, not a record of an event: findings reconcile, reopen on their
original row, and cascade-delete with their template. A finding must survive its subject moving, so
it follows — re-key its foreign keys to `resource_id`.

That is not sufficient on its own. `subject_urn` and `ignore_scope_urn` are built from
`EntityId.toUrn()`, which composes the address (`urn:epistola:template:tenantA/letters/invoice`).
`ignore_scope_urn` is in the primary key of `quality_finding_ignores` and is the join condition
between a finding and its ignore. After a move the ignore keeps the old URN while newly submitted
findings carry the new one, the join stops matching, and **every ignored finding silently reappears
as open** — breaking the "IGNORED is derived from a live ignore row" invariant that
[`quality.md`](quality.md) calls out as easy to break.

Quality subjects are templates, variants, and versions. `OnResourceRelocatedRepointFindings`
repoints both URNs when one moves, which keeps the join matching today; expressing the join on
identity is what makes it correct by construction rather than by a listener firing.

Fix by adding identity columns and matching findings to ignores on those, keeping the URN as a
display and wire value so the remote-source disposition feed contract is unchanged.

## Content references

Separate track from the relational work, and independent of it:

1. Extend the stored reference shape to `{ target, catalogKey, key }` — `target` is the resolved
   `resource_id`, the address stays as authored intent and as the fallback when `target` is null
   because the reference does not resolve.
2. Populate `target` on write, at the same seams that qualify references today —
   `TemplateDocumentPreparation` and the four stencil write paths. Extraction stays behind
   `ResourceReferenceSites` (`catalog/graph/`), which is already the single authority for what
   counts as a reference.
3. Resolve by `target` first, address second, so historical content keeps working untouched.
4. **Export strips `target`** and emits addresses, relative for same-catalog references. This is
   what keeps an exported catalog installable under a different key; a test pins it
   (`StencilCrossCatalogDependencyTest`). Import re-resolves address → `target`.

Immutable published payloads are not rewritten to carry `target`; a version published after this
lands carries it and survives any move of its dependencies. Two things keep that from stranding
older content. A published reference to a dependency that moved resolves through its alias. A
published _relative_ reference inside a resource that itself moves cannot — its meaning is "my own
catalog", which is exactly what changed — and since template and stencil versions never age out,
relocation pins such references to the catalog they resolved against, at move time, published
versions included (decided 2026-09-04; see ADR 0014). That is the same pass a later `target`
backfill would make, restricted to the resource being moved.

## What this deletes

Once a type completes the recipe, its relocation needs none of the machinery the alpha required:

- the plan/preview/fingerprint protocol — nothing to preview when nothing is rewritten
- typed rewrite strategies and the move-time pin of relative references
- address reservation, `requireAddressAvailable`, and the alias-release command
- write-time qualification, once `target` is populated

Aliases survive only as external redirects. Keep the preview command for _policy_ checks —
permissions, released catalogs, slug collisions — which remain real.

## Decisions

1. **Generation history pins.** Identity via `template_resource_id`; address columns retained as
   historical facts; composite foreign keys dropped.
2. **Quality findings follow**, and additionally need identity-based finding-to-ignore matching so
   a move does not silently reopen every ignored finding.
3. **The move command is generalised after the first re-keyed type**, not at the end, so each
   subsequent re-key delivers a movable type rather than accumulating unmovable ones.

## Still open

- Whether a released or subscribed catalog's resources may move at all, and what the portable
  handoff looks like — deferred in ADR 0014 and unchanged by this plan.
- Whether external alias redirects expire, and after how long.

## Verification

Per step: `./gradlew unitTest integrationTest`, plus `DataPreservationMigrationIT` explicitly.

Before the swap migration of any table, verify the backfill on a restored production-shaped
snapshot rather than on test fixtures — the failure mode is rows that do not match the composite
address, and fixtures will not have them.

After steps 1–6, `scripts/multi-instance-test.sh all` — the re-keying touches tables the cluster
seams depend on.
