A catalog installed from Epistola Exchange is an ordinary **subscribed** catalog: a read-only mirror
of somebody else's content, kept up to date deliberately rather than automatically. What Exchange
changes is where the content comes from and how a newer release is noticed.

## The controls

Four switches, and all of them must be on before anything can be installed.

| Control                                  | Where                 | Default | What it gates                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `epistola.exchange.enabled`              | deployment property   | `false` | The whole integration, in both directions. Nothing reaches Exchange while it is off. |
| `catalog-installing` feature             | tenant, Features page | off     | Browsing and installing, per tenant. Separate from `catalog-publishing`.             |
| An active Exchange connection            | tenant, Exchange page | none    | Installing needs a token. See below.                                                 |
| `CATALOG_MANAGE` **and** `TEMPLATE_EDIT` | permissions           | by role | Who may install. Both, see [Permissions](#permissions).                              |

`catalog-installing` is deliberately **not** the same key as `catalog-publishing`. Publishing sends
this tenant's content out; installing brings a third party's in, through the schema migrator and
into templates people generate from. An operator can reasonably want one without the other — and
sharing a key would mean that switching off publishing silently stopped upgrade checks for catalogs
already installed.

## Why installing requires a connection

Exchange's browse and download routes are public today: anyone can list catalogs and fetch a release
archive without a token. Suite requires an active tenant connection anyway.

That is a deliberate choice, not a reading of what Exchange enforces. A connection is what gives an
install an identity and an organization, and Exchange is expected to require authentication before
long so that it can rate-limit. Building on the public routes now would mean rebuilding on the
authenticated ones later.

Connect a tenant on **Settings → Exchange**; the flow is the same one publishing uses and is
documented in [catalog-exchange-publication.md](catalog-exchange-publication.md#tenant-enrollment-exactly).

## Installing

**Catalogs → Browse Exchange.** Search, open a catalog, choose a version, install.

What happens then is the existing ZIP import in its subscribed mode, so the guarantees are the ones
that path already had:

- The catalog arrives **read-only**. Editing controls are hidden and mutating commands refuse.
- Resources are mirrored: what the release contains replaces what is there, and what it no longer
  contains is removed.
- **The whole catalog installs, or none of it does.** There is no way to take a subset, and a
  resource that fails takes the rest with it — no resources are pruned, no version is advanced, and
  the next attempt starts over. See [Why a catalog is one unit](#why-a-catalog-is-one-unit).

Before any of that, and before a byte is downloaded, an install can be refused for reasons worth
knowing about.

### The catalog ID

A catalog is addressed within a tenant by the slug in its own manifest. `acme/invoices` and
`globex/invoices` therefore both want to be `invoices` here, and both would be subscribed catalogs —
so nothing about their _type_ distinguishes them.

Installing the second is **refused**, naming what already holds the ID. It is not merged, and it does
not overwrite. Installing the same catalog under a different local ID is not supported: every
cross-catalog reference in the imported templates is written against that ID, so a rename would
produce a mirror that no longer matches its source.

If you need both, install them into different tenants.

### Releases that cannot be installed

Exchange marks a release `AVAILABLE`, `BLOCKED` (scanning has not passed) or `WITHDRAWN` (pulled by
its publisher, permanently). Consumers normally never see the last two — but Exchange keeps
returning them to the installation that _publishes_ the catalog, so a tenant that both publishes and
installs would see its own. Only `AVAILABLE` releases are ever offered.

### Size and integrity

A release larger than `epistola.catalog.max-zip-size` (**10 MB** by default) is refused from its
advertised size, before the download. The download caps itself as well, because that figure is
Exchange's claim about its own body.

The archive is verified against the SHA-256 published in the release listing — a different response
from the one carrying the bytes. A mismatch is refused outright.

## Why a catalog is one unit

A catalog installs whole and upgrades whole. You cannot install three of its two hundred resources,
and an upgrade does not preserve a subset you chose earlier.

The reason is that a subset cannot be described. The version and fingerprint recorded against an
installed catalog are the publisher's statement about a **release**, so "installed 1.2.0" on an
installation holding part of 1.2.0 is not true, and every question asked afterwards inherits the
ambiguity: whether a catalog this one depends on is satisfied, what an upgrade preview is comparing
against, which resources a catalog-wide action covers.

**A publisher who wants parts adopted independently publishes more than one catalog.** That puts the
decision with the person who knows which resources belong together, and it makes the boundary
visible to everyone installing, rather than leaving each consumer to invent a subset privately.

An installation left partial by an earlier release of the Suite is topped up by its next install or
upgrade. The upgrade preview lists what will be added before anything is applied.

## Updates

Installed catalogs are checked in the background: every subscribed catalog's source is asked, every
six hours by default, whether it has published anything newer. The answer is recorded, and the
catalogs list, the navigation count and the home-page notice all render from that record rather than
asking while a page loads.

This applies to **every** subscribed catalog, not only Exchange ones — a catalog subscribed from a
manifest URL gets the same treatment. Only the asking differs.

| Property (`epistola.catalog.upstream-check.`) | Default | Meaning                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`                                     | `true`  | Turns background checking off. The per-catalog button still works.  |
| `poll-interval-ms`                            | `60000` | How often the worker looks for catalogs that are **due**.           |
| `interval`                                    | `6h`    | How long one catalog's answer is treated as current. Jittered ±15%. |
| `batch-size`                                  | `25`    | How many catalogs one tick checks.                                  |

Applying an update is always a deliberate click. Detection is automatic; the change is not.

A **withdrawn** release is reported, never acted on. The content keeps working — it is local — but
the catalog is shown as running something no longer offered, and the update it offers may be an
**older** release, because that may be the newest still available.

### What cannot be detected before downloading

Exchange publishes no catalog wire-format version on a release, so a release published by a **newer**
Epistola is only rejected when it is imported, with a message saying to upgrade this installation.
Catalogs subscribed from a manifest URL do not have this limitation — their manifest carries the
version, so the list shows "out of sync" or "upgrade Epistola" without a download. See
[ADR 0021](adr/0021-catalog-upstream-release-discovery.md).

## Relocation

Resources in an installed catalog **cannot be moved or renamed**. Relocation refuses a move whose
source or target is not an `AUTHORED` catalog, and an installed catalog is `SUBSCRIBED` — so the
Organise page will not offer them. That is the right answer rather than a gap: the catalog is a
mirror, and an address the publisher did not choose would be overwritten by the next upgrade.

Resource identities still exist for installed resources — they are minted by a database trigger on
insert, like any other resource — so an installed catalog participates in the reference graph and in
alias resolution. Uninstalling releases them along with the catalog.

Those identities are **this installation's own**. A `resource_id` is internal and is never
serialized into catalog exchange data, so an installed catalog is addressed on the wire by
`(type, catalog_key, resource_key)` exactly as the publisher wrote it, and gets fresh identities
here. The one archive that does carry identities is the tenant _snapshot_ (`identities.json`, from
archive schema 2), because restoring a tenant has to put back the identities it had — a different
archive, built and read by different code.

## Permissions

Installing requires **both** `CATALOG_MANAGE` and `TEMPLATE_EDIT`.

`CATALOG_MANAGE` is the catalog-lifecycle permission — the same one that registers, upgrades and
removes a catalog. The nested ZIP import carries `TEMPLATE_EDIT`, and authorization is enforced on
every dispatch, so the effective requirement is the pair. This is not new (applying any subscribed
upgrade has always needed both), but the two are not held by the same role: `TENANT_ADMINISTRATOR`
has the first without the second, and `CONTENT_AUTHOR` the reverse. The UI checks both, so a reader
is told before a release is downloaded rather than after.

Browsing needs only `CATALOG_VIEW`.

## Surfaces

Installing is a **web UI** capability in this delivery. The REST API and MCP server are unchanged —
the same scoping decision publication made, and for the same reason: the flows involve a browser
redirect for enrollment and a deliberate human choice of release. Revisit if a non-interactive
installation path is actually wanted.

## What is not here

- **No resource-level diff before an upgrade.** A URL-subscribed catalog gets one, built by walking
  the source manifest; an Exchange release is an archive, so its dialog shows release metadata and
  states the abort guarantee instead. A real diff would mean downloading before previewing.
- **No automatic upgrading.** Deliberate — see ADR 0021.
- **No usage reporting to Exchange**, and therefore no use of its bulk upgrades feed. ADR 0021
  explains the trade.
- **No renaming on install, no dependency display, and nothing a publisher can leave for the
  installer to supply.** All three are one design, recorded as a draft in
  [ADR 0022](adr/0022-installation-bindings.md).
