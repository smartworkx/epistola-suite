## CI/CD Workflows

All workflows are defined in `.github/workflows/`.

### Build and Test

**File:** `.github/workflows/build.yml`

**Triggers:**

- Every push to `main` (and `release/**` maintenance branches)
- Every pull request targeting `main` (or a `release/**` branch)
- Every `v*` tag (the app-release build — see [Docker Publishing](#docker-publishing))

**What it does:** the pipeline is shaped around one rule: the test jobs wait for
nothing they do not need. Tool versions come from `.mise.toml` via `mise-action`.

| Job                     | Waits for                | Does                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `compile`               | nothing                  | `pnpm build` (editor bundle + registry check), then one Gradle invocation `checkMigrationVersions ktlintCheck checkContractVersionAlignment testClasses`; uploads the Gradle build cache so the other jobs reuse compiled classes |
| `frontend-checks`       | nothing                  | `pnpm lint:check`, `lint:css`, `format:check`, `license:check`, `pnpm test`                                                                                                                                                       |
| `sbom`                  | `compile`                | backend + frontend CycloneDX SBOMs, third-party notices, VEX export, Trivy scans (critical = fail)                                                                                                                                |

| `test-ui`               | `compile`                | `gradle uiTest` (Playwright; browser cache keyed on the Playwright version)                                                                                                                                                       |
| `coverage`              | both test jobs           | coverage badge, `main` pushes only                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `docker`                | tests, checks and `sbom` | image build and publish, `v*` tags or PRs labelled `publish`                                                                                                                                                                      |

Every Gradle invocation on CI pays the full configuration phase (the
configuration cache is never reused across jobs), which is why `compile` runs one
invocation rather than one per task, and why nothing but the test tasks runs in
the test jobs.

**Required checks:** all of `compile`, `frontend-checks`, `sbom` and both test jobs
must pass before merging PRs.

### Docker Publishing

**File:** `.github/workflows/build.yml` (docker job)

The app image is published **only for app releases** — a `v*` tag — or a PR
labelled `publish` (for testing). A normal push to `main` only compiles + tests;
it does **not** build an image.

#### On a `v*` tag (app release)

`build.yml` triggers on `push: tags: ['v*']` (and `main`/`release/**` branches +
PRs for the test jobs). On the tag it:

1. Extracts the version from the tag (`v1.0.0-RC3` → `1.0.0-RC3`) and **asserts it
   equals `gradle.properties` `version`** — a mismatch (e.g. the file still says
   `-SNAPSHOT`) fails the release loudly instead of shipping a wrong image.
2. Builds the image with `gradle :apps:epistola:bootBuildImage`.
3. Pushes `ghcr.io/epistola-app/epistola-suite` with tags `:<version>`, `:<sha>`, `:latest`.
4. Signs with Cosign (keyless OIDC), attaches the SBOM attestation, and uploads the
   SBOM artifacts to the GitHub Release.

Chart tags (`epistola-*`) deliberately do **not** match `v*`, so a chart release
never triggers the app pipeline.

#### On a PR with the `publish` label

Builds + pushes a snapshot image `…:<prev-version>-pr-<number>-<run>` (e.g.
`1.0.0-RC2-pr-42-5`) for testing. Add the `publish` label to trigger.

### Helm Chart Publishing

**File:** `.github/workflows/helm.yml`

The charts (`epistola`, `epistola-grafana`) publish **only on their own chart
tag** — `<chart>-<version>` (e.g. `epistola-0.10.0`, `epistola-grafana-0.1.0`).
PRs touching `charts/**` run linting only.

#### On a `<chart>-*` tag

`helm.yml` triggers on `push: tags: ['epistola-*']`. It:

1. Parses the chart name + version from the tag (pre-release-safe).
2. **Asserts the version equals that chart's `Chart.yaml` `version:`** — a mismatch
   (e.g. `-SNAPSHOT`) fails.
3. `helm package` + pushes to `oci://ghcr.io/epistola-app/charts/<chart>:<version>`.

The GitHub Release (with notes from the chart's CHANGELOG) is created by the
`release-helm-chart` skill; this workflow only publishes to OCI. The disjoint
`v*` / `epistola-*` tag globs keep the chart and app streams from ever crossing.

### CodeQL Analysis

**File:** `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`

**Triggers:**

- Every push to `main`
- Every pull request targeting `main`
- Weekly schedule (Saturday at 6 AM UTC)

**What it does:**

1. Runs CodeQL static analysis (SAST) on two language groups in parallel:
   - **Java/Kotlin**: Custom build (Gradle `classes` task) then analysis
   - **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Autobuild then analysis
2. Uses the `security-and-quality` query suite for broader coverage
3. Uploads SARIF results to the GitHub **Security** tab → **Code scanning**

**Results:** View findings in the repository's Security tab under Code scanning alerts.

### Label Sync

**File:** `.github/workflows/labels.yml`

**Triggers:**

- On push to `main` when `.github/labels.yml` changes
- Manual trigger via Actions UI

**What it does:**

- Syncs repository labels from `.github/labels.yml`
- Strict mode: removes labels not defined in the config

**To add/modify labels:** Edit `.github/labels.yml` and push to `main`.

### Project Sync

**File:** `.github/workflows/project-sync.yml`

**Triggers:**

- On push to `main` when `.github/project.yml` changes
- Manual trigger via Actions UI

**What it does:**

- Creates or updates the "Epistola Suite Backlog" GitHub Project
- Syncs custom fields (Status, Priority, Size, Type, etc.)
- Links the repository to the project

**Configuration:** `.github/project.yml`

This workflow uses a GitHub App for authentication since the Projects v2 API is not supported by fine-grained PATs. See [GitHub App for Project Sync](#github-app-for-project-sync) for setup.

**To modify project fields:** Edit `.github/project.yml` and push to `main`.

#### Project Fields

| Field          | Type          | Options                                               |
| -------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Status         | Single select | Backlog, Ready, In Progress, Blocked, In Review, Done |
| Priority       | Single select | P0 Critical, P1 High, P2 Medium, P3 Low               |
| Size           | Single select | XS, S, M, L, XL                                       |
| Type           | Single select | Feature, Bug, Alert, Tech Debt, Chore                 |
| Target Date    | Date          | Expected delivery date                                |
| Started At     | Date          | When work began (for cycle time)                      |
| Blocked Reason | Text          | Why the item is blocked                               |

## Versioning and Releases

### Semantic Versioning

The project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

| Change Type     | Version Bump | Example       |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Breaking change | MAJOR        | 1.0.0 → 2.0.0 |
| New feature     | MINOR        | 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 |
| Bug fix         | PATCH        | 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 |

### Conventional Commits

Version bumps are determined automatically from commit messages:

| Commit Prefix                           | Version Bump |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| `feat:`                                 | MINOR        |
| `fix:`                                  | PATCH        |
| `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:` | PATCH        |
| `feat!:` or `fix!:`                     | MAJOR        |
| Footer contains `BREAKING CHANGE:`      | MAJOR        |

### Release Process

The repo ships **three independently-versioned artifacts**, each released on its
own tag. Versions are **file-truth**: every artifact's version lives in a file,
and during development carries the next version with **`-SNAPSHOT`** — so a branch
never claims a released version it isn't.

| Artifact  | Version file (source of truth)                  | Dev value            | Release tag              |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| App image | `gradle.properties` `version=`                  | `1.0.0-RC3-SNAPSHOT` | `v1.0.0-RC3`             |
| App chart | `charts/epistola/Chart.yaml` `version:`         | `0.10.0-SNAPSHOT`    | `epistola-0.10.0`        |
| Obs chart | `charts/epistola-grafana/Chart.yaml` `version:` | `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT`     | `epistola-grafana-0.1.0` |

**To release an artifact** (use the [`release`](../.agents/skills/release) skill
for the app, [`release-helm-chart`](../.agents/skills/release-helm-chart) for a
chart — same three-step shape):

1. In a PR: **strip `-SNAPSHOT`** in the version file → the release version;
   **finalize that artifact's CHANGELOG** `## [X.Y.Z]` (this section becomes the
   GitHub Release notes); merge to `main`.
2. On the merge commit: `gh release create <tag> --notes "<changelog section>" --target <sha>`.
   CI reacts to the tag, **asserts `tag == file version`**, and builds/publishes.
3. **Re-open the next `-SNAPSHOT`** in the version file.

Key properties:

- **Independent streams.** The tag globs are disjoint (`v*` vs `epistola-*`), so a
  chart release never triggers the app pipeline and vice-versa — no shared
  `release:` event, no cross-firing.
- **`tag == file` validation** doubles as a guard: a tag whose commit still holds a
  `-SNAPSHOT` fails, so you cannot accidentally release a snapshot.
- **Backports:** keep a `release/<major>.x` branch with its own `-SNAPSHOT`
  lineage + CHANGELOG; tag there to release from it. Consumers resolve by SemVer
  range (a `1.x`-pinned client gets `1.0.5`; latest-tracking stays on `main`).
- **Consumers:** charts publish to `oci://ghcr.io/epistola-app/charts/<chart>`;
  epistola-infra auto-bumps via Flux `ImagePolicy`; clients pull by version.

**Important:** app tags are `vX.Y.Z`; chart tags are `<chart-name>-X.Y.Z`.

## SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

CycloneDX SBOMs are generated for both backend and frontend dependencies and attached to each release.

| Release Artifact                       | Contents                               |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `epistola-backend-{version}-sbom.json` | Backend (Kotlin/Java) dependencies     |
| `epistola-editor-{version}-sbom.json`  | Frontend (TypeScript/npm) dependencies |

For detailed SBOM documentation, see [docs/sbom.md](sbom.md).

## Security

### Security Policy

Located at [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) in the repository root.

**Supported versions:** The two most recently released minor release lines are
supported and patched. As long as fewer than two minor release lines have been
released, all available minor release lines are supported.

**Response SLA:** 48 hours for initial acknowledgment.

### Reporting Vulnerabilities

1. Go to repository **Security** tab
2. Click **Report a vulnerability**
3. Fill out the private form

Do NOT create public issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Private Vulnerability Reporting

GitHub's private vulnerability reporting must be enabled in repository settings:

- Settings → Security → Private vulnerability reporting → Enable

### Private Remediation and Coordinated Disclosure

Accepted reports become draft repository Security Advisories. Maintainers use
the advisory's **Start a temporary private fork** action and develop the fix
there; an ordinary fork of this public repository is public and must not be used
for embargoed work.

1. Triage privately, assign the internal advisory ID, and limit collaborators
2. Create the temporary private fork and add a regression test and fix
3. Run all required checks locally because normal PR status checks do not run in the temporary fork
4. Establish affected versions, CVSS vector, fixed commit, patched version, and disclosure timing
5. Use **Merge pull request(s)** in the draft advisory when the release is ready
6. Release the patch immediately, publish the canonical repository record, and then publish the GitHub advisory

Do not push the advisory record, proof of concept, or fix to any public branch
before a patched release is ready. GitHub deletes the temporary private fork
when the advisory is published.

### Docker Image Signing

All published Docker images are cryptographically signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) with keyless OIDC signing via GitHub Actions.

#### Verify Image Signature

```bash
cosign verify ghcr.io/epistola-app/epistola-suite:<tag> \
  --certificate-identity-regexp='.*' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer='https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com'
```

#### Verify SBOM Attestation

The SBOM (CycloneDX format) is attached as a signed attestation to each image:

```bash
cosign verify-attestation ghcr.io/epistola-app/epistola-suite:<tag> \
  --type cyclonedx \
  --certificate-identity-regexp='.*' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer='https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com'
```

#### Download SBOM from Image

```bash
cosign download attestation ghcr.io/epistola-app/epistola-suite:<tag> \
  | jq -r '.payload' | base64 -d | jq '.predicate'
```

## GitHub Discussions

Use Discussions for:

- Questions and help requests
- Ideas and brainstorming
- General conversation
- Show and tell

**Not for:** Bug reports, feature requests, or security issues (use templates).

**Enable in:** Settings → Features → Discussions

## GitHub App for Project Sync

The project uses a GitHub App for CI/CD operations that require Projects v2 API access. GitHub's default `GITHUB_TOKEN` and fine-grained PATs don't support Projects v2 operations, making a GitHub App the recommended approach.

### Why a GitHub App?

- **No user account needed**: App acts as its own identity
- **Auto-rotating tokens**: Installation tokens expire in 1 hour (more secure than PATs)
- **Fine-grained permissions**: Only grant exactly what's needed
- **Better audit trail**: Actions show as `github-app[bot]`
- **No seat cost**: Apps don't consume organization seats

### Setup (One-Time)

1. **Create the GitHub App:**
   - Go to https://github.com/organizations/epistola-app/settings/apps/new
   - Configure:
     - **Name**: `epistola-project-sync` (or similar unique name)
     - **Homepage URL**: `https://github.com/epistola-app/epistola-suite`
     - **Webhook**: Uncheck "Active" (not needed)
     - **Permissions**:
       - Organization permissions → **Projects**: Read and write
       - Repository permissions → **Metadata**: Read (required)
     - **Where can this GitHub App be installed?**: Only on this account

2. **Generate credentials:**
   - After creation, note the **App ID** (shown on the app settings page)
   - Scroll to "Private keys" and click **Generate a private key**
   - Download the `.pem` file

3. **Install the app:**
   - Go to the app settings → **Install App**
   - Install on `epistola-app` organization
   - Grant access to `epistola-suite` repository

4. **Add secrets to repository:**
   - Go to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add two secrets:

   | Secret Name               | Value                            |
   | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
   | `PROJECT_APP_ID`          | The App ID from step 2           |
   | `PROJECT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | Full contents of the `.pem` file |

### How It Works

The `project-sync.yml` workflow uses `actions/create-github-app-token` to generate a short-lived installation token:

```yaml
- name: Generate GitHub App token
  uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1
  with:
    app-id: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_APP_ID }}
    private-key: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
    owner: epistola-app
```

The token is automatically scoped to the permissions configured in the app and expires after 1 hour.

### Manual Repository Linking

Linking repositories to a GitHub Project requires admin permissions that we intentionally don't grant to the sync workflow. If a repository listed in `.github/project.yml` is not linked, the workflow will fail with instructions.

**To link a repository (requires org admin):**

1. Go to the project settings → **Manage access**
2. Under "Link a repository", search for and add the repository
